Goal - Working DMR System

What tables do I need to get a dmr system?
Workorder
-Customer - done barebones 1/24
-Part - done 1/24
-Process - done barebones 1/24

I just finished getting the barebones on the DMR working. I need to add picture uploads and file uploads.
Once that works, then I can redo the quote system super fast.
Then once that's done, I need to overhaul our inspection system and then tie that in with the dmr system. Also need to add corrective actions.
